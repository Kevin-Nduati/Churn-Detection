# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The data contains information about bank customers such as job, age, marital info, education, whether or not they had housing. We try to predict whether 
a customer will subscribed a term deposit.
The data was first fitted to a Logistic Regression model. The model managed an accuracy of 91%. After this, I ran an AutoMl, where the data was fitted to 40 models. The best performing model was MaxAbsScaler LightGBM with an accuracy of 91.44%, followed by MaxAbsScaler XGBoostClassifier with an accuracy of 91.2%.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
### The Pipeline Architecture
* Create a tabular dataset using TabularDatasetFactory. The data is from <a href = "https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv">Dataset</a>
* train python scriptcontains data that is used to clean the data, and enode categorical values.
* Data is then split into train and test sets
* A Logistic Regression model is then fitted to the data
* I then used hyperdrive so as to tune hyperparameters(C and max_iter).

The results of the hyperdrive are as shown below:<br>

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
